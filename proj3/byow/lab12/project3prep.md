# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer:
He used way earlier the Position Class, I took a lot to realise that a Coordenates would be way more helpfull. He also thoung about the patter
much better, printing and moving top right, and bottom right.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer:
The tesselation is the position of rooms and hallways in the right place so we can fit the together and connect them in the right possition.
Hexagons are the rooms and hallways in my opinion
-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer:
How to draw a room of different sizes and how to draw hallways and how to position them on the world
-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer
I guess hallways are rooms of size width 1, and they are use to connect rooms.
The similarity is that both are hexagons of different sizes.
